# Customer Churn Prediction using Flask and Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecom company using data analysis, machine learning, and a simple web interface built with Flask. The goal is to identify potential churners early and help businesses take proactive retention steps.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Telecom companies often lose customers due to poor service, high charges, or competitor offers. This project aims to build a churn prediction model that uses customer demographic and usage data to identify churn patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze customer behavior and churn trends.
- Use clustering techniques to group high-risk customers.
- Build a machine learning model to predict churn.
- Provide a simple web interface for data input and predictions.
- Suggest retention strategies based on the insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (for web app)
- Pandas, NumPy (data handling)
- Scikit-learn (ML modeling)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)
- HTML/CSS (frontend)
- Jupyter Notebook (analysis)

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- Exploratory Data Analysis with visual insights
- K-Means Clustering to group similar churn behaviors
- Gradient Boosting Classifier for prediction
- Flask-based web app to interact with the model
- Retention strategy suggestions based on clusters

## ✅ Results

- Churn rate observed: **~26%**
- Top predictors: **Tenure**, **Monthly Charges**, **Contract Type**, and **Payment Method**
- Identified customer segments most likely to churn
- Built a working model and integrated it into a user-friendly web app
